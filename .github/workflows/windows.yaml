# Remember kids, the default shell here is Powershell
# Don't run with python 3.3 as using python -m to run flake8 or pytest will fail.
# Hence, without python -m, pytest will not have it's PYTHONPATH set to current dir and imports will fail
# Don't run with python 3.4 as github cannot install it (pip install --upgrade pip fails)
